# Data-ETL-from-Web-Sources
This is my first personal project on Data ETL using Python and PostgreSQL with the help of AI. The data is specifically processed on the period of night-time weather and specifically in Southeast Asian cities during the first week of September. I collected daily real-time data from openweathermap.org with the help of Cron Jobs. As a result, I can provide data that’s ready to be analyzed.

Additionally, I included comments in my python script to document the purpose of each section, so it’s easier for me to review and relearn later.
