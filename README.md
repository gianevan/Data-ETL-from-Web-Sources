# Data-ETL-from-Web-Sources
This is my first personal project on Data ETL using Python and PostgreSQL with the help of AI. The project focuses on analyzing night-time weather in Southeast Asian cities during the first week of September. I collected daily real-time data from openweathermap.org with Cron Jobs, performed the ETL process. Additionally, I included comments in my python script to document the purpose of each section, so itâ€™s easier for me to review and relearn later. As the result the ETL data is all set and ready to be analyzed.
