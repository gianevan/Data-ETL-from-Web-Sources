# Data-ETL-from-Web-Sources
This is my first personal project on Data ETL using Python and PostgreSQL. In this project, I implemented a daily automated pipeline with Cron to run the Python script throughout the week. The collected data is then stored, visualized in both tables and charts, and prepared for further analysis.
